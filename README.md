SAGA
====

The [SAGA Survey](http://sagasurvey.org/) is a spectroscopic survey that aims
to determine dwarf galaxy satellite systems around 100 Milky Way analogs down
to the brightness of the Leo I galaxy (Mr < âˆ’12.3).

This `SAGA` package contains code to generate and access SAGA data catalogs.


## Installation

To install the code, run:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/sagasurvey/saga/archive/master.zip
```

To force an update, run
```bash
pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall https://github.com/sagasurvey/saga/archive/master.zip
```

The code should be compatible with Python 3.5+,
but has mainly been tested with Python 3.6.

### Dependencies

All required dependencies will be installed automatically.
There are two optional dependencies that require manual installation:

1. casjobs OR sciservevr

   You need to install [casjobs](https://github.com/dfm/casjobs) or [sciservevr](https://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python) to download SDSS catalogs.

   * To install casjobs:
     ```sh
     pip install https://github.com/dfm/casjobs/archive/master.zip
     ```
     (Note: Do *NOT* use `pip install casjobs` as the version on PyPI is outdated.)

   * To install sciservevr:
     ```sh
     pip install -e "git+https://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python.git@sciserver-v2.0.13#egg=SciServer-2.0.13&subdirectory=py3"
     ```
   In both cases you need to set environmental variables to store your credentials. (`CASJOBS_WSID` and `CASJOBS_PW` for casjobs; `SCISERVER_USER` and `SCISERVER_PASS` for sciserver).

2. Extreme Deconvolution

   You only need to install [Extreme Deconvolution](https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution) if you want to build GMM (you don't need it to use GMMs).

   ```sh
   pip install https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution/archive/master.zip
   ```


## Usage

When using `SAGA`, your code would almost always start with this block:

```python
import SAGA
saga_database = SAGA.Database('/path/to/saga/dropbox/folder', '/path/to/saga/local/folder')
saga_host_catalog = SAGA.HostCatalog(saga_database)
saga_object_catalog = SAGA.ObjectCatalog(saga_database)
```

```python
from SAGA import ObjectCuts as C

# load host list
hosts = saga_host_catalog.load()

# load base catalogs of Paper I hosts
base_paper1 = saga_object_catalog.load(hosts='paper1', return_as='list')

# count number of satellites
for base in base_paper1:
    print(base['HOST_ID'][0], '# of satellites =', C.is_sat.count(base))
```

You can find more examples at https://github.com/sagasurvey/examples/tree/master/notebooks

You can also find the schema for the host list and for object catalogs at [SCHEMA.md].
